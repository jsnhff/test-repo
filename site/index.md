In the best stories we see ourselves in the characters we encounter.  Their identity can become our own or at least a new way of seeing ourselves.

Names, genders, pronouns, and titles make up a character‚Äôs basic identity. Each attribute presents a history, roles, constraints, and heirarchy. Mix in actions and power dynamics are revealed, reinforced, or reinvented. One action taken by a man can be read differently as the same action taken by a woman.

I hope this project helps create new expereinces, questions, and understandings.

	<p class="col-start-2 col-span-4 text-xl leading-relaxed mt-8">We‚Äôd love help improving this project. Finding matching pronouns for characters (coreferencing) across an entire book is complicated. Working on this project made me realize how much I take that simple ability for granted when I read.

If you know Python, are familiar with Natural Language Processing, and know your way around Git then you can help.

We‚Äôre focused on these top three challenges:</p>
	<ol class="col-start-2 col-span-4 list-decimal text-xl leading-relaxed list-inside">
		<li class="pb-4">Multiple character identification.</li>
		<li class="pb-4">Cleaner character coreference identification in paragraphs with multiple characters of the same original gender.</li>
		<li>Making this project accessible on the web for more humans.</li>
